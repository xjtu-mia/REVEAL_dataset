# REVEAL_dataset

**1. Introduction to the REVEAL dataset**
* REVEAL (REtinal arteriole &VEnule AnLysis) includes three sets of images of different image quality and disease signs. Specifically, REVEAL1 includes ten images from ten participants with diabetes mellitus (Topcon TRC-NW6S retinal camera, FOV of 45o, image size 3872×2592 pixels). This dataset contains early signs of diabetic retinopathy, such as microaneurysm and exudates. REVEAL2 includes 10 images from ten subjects (Kowa nonmyd α-D VK-2, FOV of 45o, image size 1600×1270 pixels). REVEAL2 shows severe signs of diabetic retinopathy, such as large hemorrhage. REVEAL3 includes ten low quality fundus images from ten normal subjects. The images were acquired using a smartphone-compatible fundus camera (iExaminer plus ‘Panoptic’, FOV of 25o, Welch-Allyn Inc., Skaneateles Fall, NY, USA).
* Two well-trained graders (G1 and G2) manually labeled all arterioles and venules in the images. G1 manually labeled two datasets (REVEAL 1&2) and G2 manually labeled two datasets (REVEAL 1&3). For REVEAL1, G1 is regarded as ground truth and inter-grader repeatability is assessed for G2. Four labels are given in the manual segmentation (i.e., red, blue, green, and white for arterioles, venules, crossings, and uncertain vessels).

**2. How to use the database**
* The data included in this database can be used, free of charge, for research and educational purposes. Copying, redistribution, and any unauthorized commercial use is prohibited. The use of this database is restricted to those individuals or organizations that obtained the database directly from this website.
