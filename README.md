# REVEAL_dataset

1. Introduction to the REVEAL dataset
REVEAL (REtinal arteriole &VEnule AnLysis) includes three sets of images of different image quality and disease signs. Specifically, REVEAL1 includes ten images from ten participants with diabetes mellitus (Topcon TRC-NW6S retinal camera, FOV of 45o, image size 3872×2592 pixels). This dataset contains early signs of diabetic retinopathy, such as microaneurysm and exudates. REVEAL2 includes 10 images from ten subjects (Kowa nonmyd α-D VK-2, FOV of 45o, image size 1600×1270 pixels). REVEAL2 shows severe signs of diabetic retinopathy, such as large hemorrhage. REVEAL3 includes ten low quality fundus images from ten normal subjects. The images were acquired using a smartphone-compatible fundus camera (iExaminer plus ‘Panoptic’, FOV of 25o, Welch-Allyn Inc., Skaneateles Fall, NY, USA).
